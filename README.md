This project has two different parts. First one is a good, old minesweeper game, and the other part is supposed to solve it!

# Installing requirements

```sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev ```

# Execuing program
For executing the game, go to the Game folder and run ```make``` command. You will be asked for width, height and number of mines in the game. Then the game will start.
